I am contrasting the syntactical and semantic differences among **javascript**, **python** and **php**.
Including similar concepts, tricks and tips.

For example in javascript, **destructuring** is used to extract the individual properties in an object  

In python similar thing is done with tuples although with a different name, **unpacking**.  

In php the **extract** function is used to achieve same outcome on objects.  

Another example, variables in javascript can be either function or blocked scope. In python, they are only function scoped. In php, function, block and static.
